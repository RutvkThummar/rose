Krishi Management system. This document outlines the requirements for the system, including its functionality, user interactions, and non-functional characteristics.

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for a Krishi Management system, which aims to provide farmers and agricultural stakeholders with a comprehensive platform for managing farming activities, crop information, and market data.

1.2 Scope
The Krishi Management system will provide a user-friendly interface for farmers, agricultural experts, and administrators to manage crops, monitor farm activities, access weather information, analyze market trends, and collaborate on farming practices. The system will also include features for data visualization, reporting, and knowledge sharing.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Registration and Authentication

The system shall provide a user registration feature for farmers and agricultural experts to create an account.
Users shall be able to log in using their credentials (e.g., username, password).
The system shall authenticate users and provide access based on user roles (e.g., farmer, agricultural expert, administrator).
2.2 Crop Management

Farmers shall be able to add, update, and delete crop information, including crop name, variety, planting date, and harvesting date.
The system shall provide recommendations on crop selection based on soil type, climate, and market demand.
Farmers shall be able to track crop growth, monitor pest attacks, and record treatments.
2.3 Farm Activity Monitoring

Farmers shall be able to record and track farm activities such as irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application.
The system shall provide reminders and notifications for upcoming farm activities based on crop lifecycle and weather conditions.
Farmers shall be able to generate activity reports for analysis and decision-making.
2.4 Weather Information

The system shall integrate with weather APIs to provide real-time weather data such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity.
Farmers shall be able to view weather forecasts for their farming locations.
The system shall provide alerts and recommendations based on weather conditions to help farmers make informed decisions.
2.5 Market Analysis and Price Trends

The system shall provide market data and price trends for different crops and regions.
Farmers shall be able to access market analysis reports, including demand, supply, and price fluctuations.
The system shall provide insights and recommendations for crop selection and pricing strategies.
2.6 Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing

Farmers and agricultural experts shall be able to communicate and share knowledge within the system.
Users shall be able to participate in discussion forums, ask questions, and share best practices.
The system shall allow the upload and sharing of documents, articles, and educational resources.
2.7 Data Visualization and Reporting

The system shall provide graphical representations (e.g., charts, graphs) of crop information, farm activities, and market data.
Farmers shall be able to generate reports and analyze trends for informed decision-making.
The system shall provide customizable dashboards for users to monitor key metrics and KPIs.
3. Non-functional Requirements
3.1 Performance

The system shall be able to handle multiple concurrent users and maintain responsiveness.
The response time for user interactions (e.g., data retrieval, report generation) shall be within acceptable limits.
3.2 Security

User passwords shall be securely stored using encryption techniques.
The system shall implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Access to sensitive data (e.g., crop information, farm activities) shall be controlled based on user roles and permissions.
3.3 Usability

The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate.
The system shall provide helpful notifications, tooltips, and error messages.
The system shall support different languages and accessibility standards
