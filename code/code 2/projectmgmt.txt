1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for an online project management system, which enables users to effectively plan, track, and collaborate on projects.

1.2 Scope
The online project management system will provide a user-friendly interface for project managers, team members, and stakeholders to create projects, assign tasks, monitor progress, and communicate. The system will also include features for document management, reporting, and integration with other tools.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Registration and Authentication

The system shall provide a user registration feature for new users to create an account.
Users shall be able to log in using their credentials (e.g., username, password).
The system shall authenticate users and provide access based on user roles (e.g., project manager, team member).
2.2 Project Creation and Management

Project managers shall be able to create new projects, providing project details (e.g., name, description, start date, end date).
Project managers shall be able to assign team members to projects and define their roles.
The system shall allow project managers to set project milestones and track their progress.
2.3 Task Management

Project managers shall be able to create tasks within projects, providing task details (e.g., name, description, due date, priority).
Project managers shall be able to assign tasks to team members and set task dependencies.
Team members shall be able to view and update their assigned tasks, mark them as complete, and provide task status updates.
2.4 Document Management

The system shall provide a centralized repository for uploading, storing, and organizing project documents.
Users shall be able to categorize documents, add tags, and provide descriptions.
The system shall support version control for documents and allow users to download or preview them.
2.5 Communication and Collaboration

The system shall provide features for real-time communication and collaboration among project team members.
Users shall be able to send messages, share files, and participate in discussion forums.
The system shall maintain a history of project-related communications and activities.
2.6 Reporting and Analytics

The system shall generate reports on project progress, task completion, and resource allocation.
Project managers shall be able to view graphical representations of project data, such as Gantt charts or burn-down charts.
The system shall provide insights and analytics to help stakeholders make informed decisions.
3. Non-functional Requirements
3.1 Performance

The system shall be able to handle multiple concurrent users and maintain responsiveness.
The response time for user interactions (e.g., loading projects, updating tasks) shall be within acceptable limits.
3.2 Security

User passwords shall be securely stored using encryption techniques.
The system shall implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Access to projects, tasks, and documents shall be controlled based on user roles and permissions.
3.3 Usability

The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate.
The system shall provide helpful notifications, tooltips, and error messages.
The system shall support different languages and accessibility standards.
4. Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

[Here, you can include the ER diagram for the database schema of the project management system. Please note that without the specific details of your system, I can only provide a generic example to help you get started.]

[Example ER Diagram]

Entities:

User (user_id, username, password, email, role)
Project (project_id, name, description, start_date, end_date
)

Task (task_id, project_id, name, description, due_date, priority, status)
Document (document_id, project_id, name, description, file_path, version)
Message (message_id, project_id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp)
Relationships:

User-Project (Many-to-Many)
User-Task (Many-to-Many)
Project-Task (One-to-Many)
Project-Document (One-to-Many)
User-Message (One-to-Many)
5. Glossary

User: An individual who interacts with the online project management system.
Project Manager: A user responsible for creating and managing projects, assigning tasks, and monitoring progress.
Team Member: A user assigned to specific tasks within a project.
Task: An activity or deliverable within a project that needs to be completed.
Document: Files and resources related to projects, such as project plans, specifications, or design documents.
[Include any additional sections or information as needed for your specific project.]

This is a basic template for an SRS document. You can expand and modify it according to the specific requirements of your online project management system.
